Important cloud computing interview questions

1. What is a Cloud Technology?

A cloud is a combination of services, networks, hardware, storage, and interfaces that helps in delivering computing as a service. It broadly has three users. These are the end-user, business management user, and cloud service, provider. The end-user is the one who uses the services provided by the cloud. The responsibility of the data and the services provided by the cloud is taken by the business management user in the cloud. The one who takes care of or is responsible for the maintenance of the IT assets of the cloud is the cloud service provider. The cloud acts as a common center for its users to fulfill their computing needs.

2. What are some of the key features of Cloud Computing?

The following are some of the key features of cloud computing:

1. Agility: Helps in quick and inexpensive re-provisioning of resources.
2. Location Independence: This means that the resources can be accessed from everywhere.
3. Multi-Tenancy: The resources are shared amongst a large group of users.
4. Reliability: Resources and computation can be dependable for accessibility.
5. Scalability: Dynamic provisioning of data helps in scaling. 

3. What do you mean by cloud delivery models?

Cloud delivery models are models that represent the computing environments. These are as follows:

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the delivery of services, including an operating system, storage, networking, and various utility software elements, on a request basis. 
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a mechanism for combining Infrastructure as a Service with an abstracted set of middleware services, software development, and deployment tools. These allow the organization to have a consistent way to create and deploy applications on a cloud or on-premises environment.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Software as a Service (SaaS) is a business application created and hosted by a provider in a multi-tenant model. 
4. Function as a Service (FaaS): Function as a Service (FaaS) gives a platform for customers to build, manage and run app functionalities without the difficulty of maintaining infrastructure. One can thus achieve a "serverless" architecture.
